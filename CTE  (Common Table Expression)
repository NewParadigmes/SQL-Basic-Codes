CTE - A common table expression, is a temporary named result set created from a simple SELECT statement that can be used in a subsequent SELECT statement. Each SQL CTE is like a named query, whose result is stored in a virtual table (a CTE) to be referenced later in the main query.

(select FirstName, LastName, Gender,Salary,
count(gender) over (partition by gender) as totalgender
from EmployeeDemographics Dem
join EmployeeSalary Sal
on dem.EmployeeID = Sal.EmployeeID
)
