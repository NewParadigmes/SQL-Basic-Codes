The CASE expression goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement). 
So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.

If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.


Select FirstName, LastName, Age,
case
when age > 30 then 'old'
else 'young'
end
from EmployeeDemographics
where age is not null
order by age

When we want to make some calculation. 

Select FirstName, LastName, Jobtitle, Salary,
case 
	when Jobtitle = 'salesman' then Salary + (salary * .10)
	when Jobtitle = 'accountant' then salary + (salary * .05)
	when Jobtitle = 'hr' then Salary + (Salary * .00001)
	else salary + (salary * .03)
	end as SalaryAfterRaise
from EmployeeDemographics
join EmployeeSalary
on EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID
