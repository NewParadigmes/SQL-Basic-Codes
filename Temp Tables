Temporary tables are tables that exist temporarily on the SQL Server.

The temporary tables are useful for storing the immediate result sets that are accessed multiple times.

Create table #temp_Employee(
EmployeeId int,
Jobtitile varchar(100),
Salary int)

Insert into #temp_Employee values ('1001', 'HR', '45000')

Select *
from #temp_Employee

Insert into #temp_Employee
Select *
From EmployeeSalary


Create Table #temp_Employee2 (
JobTitle varchar(50),
EmployeesPerJob int,
AvgAge int,
AvgSalary int)

We can create a temp table using already exsisting temp. 

Insert into #temp_Employee2
Select JobTitle, COUNT(Jobtitle), Avg(Age), AVG(salary)
From EmployeeDemographics emp
join EmployeeSalary sal
on emp.EmployeeID = sal.EmployeeID
group by JobTitle


Select *
from #temp_Employee2
