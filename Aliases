Using Aliases (AS) give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.

An alias only exists for the duration of that query.

An alias is created with the AS keyword.

select demo.EmployeeID, sal.EmployeeID
from EmployeeDemographics as demo
join EmployeeSalary as Sal
on demo.EmployeeID = sal.EmployeeID
